Hides/blocks:

- All comments 
- All recommendations
- Chat window in live streaming
- Auto-play the next video (unless you are using a playlist)
- End-screen recommendations & annotations (may block in-video annotations, too)
- Miniplayer (shows up when you go back to a search page/playlist while playing a video)
- Toast notification (shows up for e.g. slow/interrupted connections and won't go away until you click on "X")

Also:
- Temporary fix for slow loading
